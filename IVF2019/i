State-of-the-art methods in computer vision and computer graphics make it feasible to edit images and videos in a visually plausible way. This allows non-expert users with off-the-shelf hardware to create believable content that is oftentimes barely distinguishable from original recordings.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from computer vision, computer graphics, and image processing to advance the state-of-the-art in detecting post-hoc image manipulations, and in linking images and video to camera models or even individual devices.

With the widespread diffusion of powerful media editing tools,
falsifying images and videos has become easier and easier in the last
few years.
Fake multimedia represents a growing menace in many fields of life,
notably in politics, journalism, and the judiciary.  In response to this
threat, a large number of methods have been proposed, relying both on
signal processing and deep learning approaches.  In this talk some
promising solutions will be described for the detection and localization
of conventional and emerging attacks to multimedia integrity, including
computer graphics and GAN-based manipulations.

Dr. Matt Turek joined DARPAâ€™s Information Innovation Office (I2O) as a program manager in July 2018. His research interests include computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence and their application to problems with significant societal impact.

<P>
Prior to his position at DARPA, Dr. Turek was at Kitware, Inc., where he helped lead a 40 person computer vision team. His research has focused in multiple areas including large scale behavior recognition and modeling; object detection; activity recognition; normalcy modeling and anomaly detection; and image indexing and retrieval. Dr. Turek has made significant contributions to multiple DARPA and Air Force Research Lab efforts and has transitioned large scale systems for operational use. Before joining Kitware, Turek worked for GE Global Research, conducting research in medical imaging and industrial inspection.

<P>
Dr. Turek holds a Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Marquette University, and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. His doctoral work focused on combinatorial optimization techniques for computer vision problems. Dr. Turek is a co-inventor on 14 patents and co-author of multiple publications, primarily in computer vision.

Dr. Luisa Verdoliva is Associate Professor at University Federico II of
Naples.  She has been Guest Professor at the
Friedrich-Alexander-University in Erlangen (May-October 2018).  Her
research activity focuses on multimedia forensics, in particular on
source identification, image and video forgery detection and
localization.  She is Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on
Information Forensics and Security (2018-2020) and has been member of
the IEEE Information Forensics and Security Technical Committee
(2016-2018).  She is the Principal Investigator for the Research Unit of
University Federico II of Naples in the DISPARITY (Digital, Semantic and
Physical Analysis of Media Integrity) project funded by DARPA (Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency) under the MEDIFOR program.  She led
her research group in several international contests, including the
recent 2018 IEEE Signal Processing Cup on camera model identification
(first prize) and the 2013 IEEE Image Forensics Challenge (first prize
both in the detection and localization tasks).

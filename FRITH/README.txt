FRITH is a dataset containing forgeries, in which the images have been tampered by professionals. In total, 255 historic forged images were collected. Along with these, authentic (untampered) versions of 155 forged images were also obtained. The forged images contain a variety of image forgeries such as copyâ€“move and splicing forgeries by transferring objects or regions, forgery by inserting fake objects, manipulation of existing objects, forged images being post-processed using lightening efects and image enhancement/tuning operations. 

Details of the directories and files are provided below:

Forged: Directory containing the tampered images. The image filename suffixes indicates the forgery type: Splicing (S), Copy-Move (CM), Splicing (S), Retouching (RT).

Authentic: Directory containing the original source images that were used to create the forgeries (where available). The filenames have the same ID (1-229) as the corresponding tampered images.

FRITH.xlsx: The forgery types are listed for each tampered image.

FRITH is a dataset containing forgeries, in which the images have been tampered by professionals.
In total, 255 historic forged images were collected.
Along with these, authentic (untampered) versions of 155 forged images were also obtained.
The forged images contain a variety of
image forgeries such as copyâ€“move and splicing forgeries
by transferring objects or regions, forgery by inserting fake
objects, manipulation of existing objects, forged images
being post-processed using lightening efects and image
enhancement/tuning operations.

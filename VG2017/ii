Having depth data at hand based on stereo vision proves to be of very good value for achieving
accurate photo effects which depend on 3D scene geometry. The talk reports about photo-artistic image
rendering: the simulation of fog in photos, the generation of bokeh effects, or the creation of star
effects
in night-time photos. The reported work benefited from high-quality stereo results, but also from accurate
object segmentation results providing visually satisfying object silhouettes.

The estimation of the high quality camera motion is an essential part for many video editing methods. This
talk reports a novel 2D mesh-based motion model, MeshFlow, for the recovery of the camera motion. The
MeshFlow is a spatially smooth sparse motion field with motion vectors only at the mesh vertexes. Compared
with a single parametric model (e.g., a homography), it can represent spatially variant motions caused by
depth variations. Compared with dense optical flows, it is lightweight and more efficient. We will show how
to estimate the MeshFlow motion model. Then, we will introduce the underlying applications, including video
stabilization, video stitching, video denoising, etc.

Image understanding is one of the most important tasks in both computer vision and computer graphics. How
to understand images with little user annotation data is not only important for computer vision researchers
to extract meanings from these images, but also important for computer graphics researchers to
intelligently interact with the images with little efforts. We will show how low level vision cues, e.g.
attention, boundary, over-segmentation, could be used for such light weighted semantic segmentation. We
will also introduce how such scene understanding results could be used in applications, such as: image
manipulation, synthesis, web images understanding, etc.

Ming-Ming Cheng is an associate professor with CCCE, Nankai University. He received his PhD degree
from Tsinghua University in 2012 under guidance of Prof. Shi-Min Hu, and working closely with Prof.
Niloy Mitra. Then he worked as a research fellow for 2 years, working with Prof. Philip Torr in Oxford.
Dr. Chengâ€™s research primarily centers on algorithmic issues in image understanding and processing,
including image segmentation, editing, retrieval, etc. He has published over 30 papers in leading
journals and conferences, such as IEEE TPAMI, ACM TOG, ACM SIGGRAPH, IEEE CVPR, and IEEE ICCV. He has
designed a series of popular methods and novel systems, indicated by 5000+ paper citations (1700+
citations to his first author paper on salient object detection). His work has been reported by several
famous international media, such as BBC, UK telegraph, Der Spiegel, and Huffington Post. See also:

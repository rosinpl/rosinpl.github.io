<H1>Extracting Natural Scales of Curves</H1>
<P>
An alternative to representing curves at a single scale or a fixed number
of multiple scales is to represent them only at their <B>natural</B>
(i.e. most significant) scales. This allows all the important information
concerning the different sized structures contained in the curve to be
explicitly represented without the overhead of redundant representations of
the curve.

<P>
Our earlier work developed techniques for determining global natural scales
of curves, and found that the normalised number of points of inflection
worked well.
More recently we have looked at the more difficult task of estimating local
natural scales of curves.
Since these estimates are more sensitive to noise and other variations
merging across and within scales is applied to reduce fragmentation.

<P>
Examples of the overlapping sections of the curve represented at their
natural scales are shown below:

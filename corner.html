<H1>Extracting Corner Properties</H1>
<P>
The three most commonly used features in computer vision are regions, edges,
and corners.
Whereas regions are normally
attributed properties to make them useful as input for subsequent processing
stages such as matching,
little except for strength was extracted by early edge and corner
detectors

<P>
We describe methods to measure the following properties of grey level
corners:
subtended angle, orientation, contrast, bluntness (or rounding of the apex),
and boundary curvature (for cusps).
Unlike most of the published methods for extracting these properties
these methods are relatively simple, efficient and robust.
They rely on the corner being pre-detected by a standard operator,
thus making the measurement problem more tractable.

<P>
Some examples are shown below:

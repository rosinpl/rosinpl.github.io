CONVEXITY
=========

This code implements a convexity measure that copes with shapes that consist
of one or more open curves.

for details see

FORMATS
=======

Data is given as pixel coordinates in my simple pixel format. See *.pix data files for examples.

The data files included have all been pre-processed using Ramer's polygonalisation algorithm.

COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROGRAMS
==================================

Just type make to compile the programs

Run the scripts run3.sh & run4.sh to replicate results in figures 3 & 4

Code for computing symmetry by finding a "robust" convex hull, as described in:

P.L. Rosin, C.L. Mumford,
A symmetric convexity measure,
Computer Vision and Image Understanding, vol. 103, no. 2, pp. 101-111, 2006.

An example of calling the program is:

convexityCM10 pear.pix CH.pix

It outputs some shape measures and also the "robust" convex hull (CH.pix)

<br><b><font size=+1>Guest Editors: Dr. Paul Rosin and Dr. Omer Rana, University

<p><font size=-1>Vision is one of the most important sources of information
for supporting intelligent human behaviour, as well as a key competence
for designing new types of intelligent computers and machines. Over the
period of the past 40 years or so, computer vision has evolved into a mature
subject including many topics and applications which range from the automatic
interpretation of documents to the image recognition for the automatic
guidance of vehicles. In reality, however, current computer vision systems
are vastly different from, and in most ways inferior to, biological vision
systems.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Software agents are computer programs capable of flexible,
autonomous action - and may support a wide range of different behaviours,
defined as rules, or based on machine learning algorithms such as neural
networks. Agents also, generally, monitor their operating environment and
respond to events in a timely fashion, utilising internal scheduling and
planning engines to formulate a response. Perhaps the most significant
advantage that an agent based approach provides is the ability to design
systems based on decoupled units - based on the particular role that such
a unit is likely to play within a multi-agent system.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Authors are encouraged to submit papers which cover some
of the following issues (although this list is not exhaustive):</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=-1>Agent based image processing</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Real time image analysis using agents</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Scene interpretation using agents</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Image based content retrieval</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Visual queries in semantic search</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Target tracking using agent approaches</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>Agent societies to support semantic queries</font></li>
</ul>
<font size=-1>Application papers which demonstrate these ideas - and in
particular, show how the agent based approach is beneficial (or not) -
are especially encouraged.</font>

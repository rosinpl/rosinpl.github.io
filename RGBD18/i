RGB-D images capture both photometric and geometric information,
and over the last few years the cost of
RGB-D sensors has dropped while their accuracy has increased.
RGB-D sensors and analytics is a timely topic, as
RGB-D data is now
widespread and has been incorporated into many applications,
such as health care, robotics, fashion, metrology, vehicular technology.
<p>
However, data is still typically noisy and incomplete, data processing
techniques still lag behind traditional image modalities, real-time processing
of data becomes more challenging as data volumes increase. Therefore, many
research challenges remain.

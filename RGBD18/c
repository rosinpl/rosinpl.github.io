RGB-D images capture both photometric and geometric information,
and over the last few years the cost of
RGB-D sensors has dropped while their accuracy has increased.
RGB-D sensors and analytics is a timely topic, as
RGB-D data is now
widespread and has been incorporated into many applications,
such as health care, robotics, fashion, metrology, vehicular technology.
<p>
However, data is still typically noisy and incomplete, data processing
techniques still lag behind traditional image modalities, real-time processing
of data becomes more challenging as data volumes increase. Therefore, many
research challenges remain.

<p>
The benefit of this workshop will be to provide the opportunity for people from
disparate areas such as computer vision, robotics, graphics, as well as
application areas such as healthcare and creative industries, to exchange
ideas.

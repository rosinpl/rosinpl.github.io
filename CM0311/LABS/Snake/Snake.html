A "snake" aka "active contour".
</FONT>

<P>
Press the <B>Initialise</B> button and draw a contour in the image with the mouse.

<P>
On pressing <B>Refine</B> the contour is closed and resampled
(to be even and dense) and
the snake will move the contour points towards edges in the image
(actually using the distance tranform of the thresholded edge map)
while trying to maintain even sampling and low curvature.

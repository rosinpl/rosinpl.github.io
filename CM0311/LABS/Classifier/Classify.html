A simple fish classifier - based on two shape properties: circularity and ellipticity.

<P>
Select samples from two of the rows to train the classifier
(i.e. for two of the rows click on one or more of the fish).
The circularity and ellipticity means of each row are used to determine a linear
decision rule which is then applied to all the data.
The learnt classification is shown by filling the fish either black or gray.

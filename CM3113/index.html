A note for Maths students:
</B>
<bR>
<I>
Since the module is being run in the Department of Computer Science we expect that
all students taking the module <B>CAN</B> program.
However, for students from departments other than Computer Science the
programming language need not be Java.
For instance, if you can program in Pascal, C, or even Matlab this
would be satisfactory.

Remember that I use the PGM (Portable Gray Map) format as it is one of the
simplest methods for image representations, and is lossless.
("It's so
simple that most people will simply reverse engineer it because it's easier
than reading this specification" - Jef Poskanzer - pgm man page).
</p><p>
There are plenty of utilities in the lab classroom under Unix/Linux for
displaying PGM images (e.g. <b>xv, gimp</b>).
</p><p>
If you want to do some of the labs or coursework using Windows then you may
want to convert some images to another format if you don't have facilities for viewing
on Windows.
You can use the Unix/Linux image display tools or Unix/Linux command line utilities
such as <b>ppmtogif</b>.
</p><p>
In case you want to write your programs in C then here is some
<a href="Ccode.zip">C code</a>
to help you read and write PGM and PPMs.
</p>

<p>
Here some short example programs (mostly translated from C to Java)
to help you understand some of the algorithms I cover in the module: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="Equalise.java">histogram equalisation</a>
</li><li>
<a href="ThresholdOtsu.java">image thresholding (Otsu algorithm)</a>
</li><li>
<a href="Corners.java">corner detection (Kitchen/Rosenfeld algorithm)</a>
[this method is no longer included in my lectures, but it may still be of interest]
</li><li>
<a href="Labelling.java">connected component labelling (simple recursive version)</a>
</li>
</p>
</ul>

Note that on this and other pages I provide links to some applets.
Unfortunately it is not possible to run applets through the browser nowadays,
but you can still run at least some of them using <b>appletviewer</b>.

Try out the following demo:

The following is a nice "cut and paste" exercise (with paper and glue!) that
demonstrates the perceptual illusion of depth inversion.
Print it out and get cutting...

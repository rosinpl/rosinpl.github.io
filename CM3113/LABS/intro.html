<HR>

<P>
To start you off, here's a simple Java
<A HREF="Invert.java">program</A>
(which uses <A HREF="Image.java">Image.java</A>)
<!--
(alternatively for Maths students you can use the C
<A HREF="invert.c">program</A> instead)
-->
for reading in a PGM image such as
<A HREF="lena.pgm">lena</A>
inverting the intensities, and writing them back out to a file
as another PGM image.
After compilation, call the program as
<B>java Invert input-image output-image</B>.

<P>
Save the program and image, and check that the program works.

<P>
Now try modifying the program in some basic ways, and apply it to some images.
<li>
rescale the image intensities by a factor of 0.4
<li>
rescale the image intensities by a factor of 1.4
<li>
rescale the image intensities by a factor of 1.4 and clip overflows
(i.e. reset values greater than 255 to 255)
<li>
flip image upside-down

<P>
Now have a go at using Matlab. 
Look at the basic 
<A HREF="matlab.html">tutorial</A>
to get started.

<P>
Once you have familiarised yourself with its workings repeat the exercise above
in Matlab.
The trickiest task is the clipping, and there at least three ways to do it:
<li>
using <b>for</b> loops
<li>
using the <b>find</b> command
<li>
using the <b>></b> operator to generate masks.

<P>
To finish off, try out a Java
<A HREF="DTmatch/DTmatch.html">applet</A>
that demonstrates <b>ear matching</b>!

<H2>Lab Sheet - Week 9</H2>
<H2>Hough Transform</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Start off by playing with this
<A HREF="../duality-demo/index.html">demo</A>
(taken from
https://github.com/tdeck/duality).
You can enter points (unfortunately not lines) in either space, and move them.

<P>
Another
<A HREF="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/henli/programs/duality-demo/">demo</A>
allows you to enter (but not move) points and lines (but only in the primary space).

<HR>

<P>
Here is an image of a
<A HREF="breast.pgm">chicken breast</A>.
The shape can be described fairly well by a <B>cardioid</B>, whose
parametric equation is given by
<BR>
<IMG SRC="x.png" ALT="x" HEIGHT=25>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="y.png" ALT="y" HEIGHT=25>

<P>
Write a program to implement the Hough Transform which finds the cardioid in the above image.
You can assume that the scale (a=69) is known, leaving only the centre coordinates to be found.
You can further assume that the centre lies within the image.  The result should look something like the following:

<P>
I used the Sobel edge detector followed by thresholding to extract features:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="breast-sobel.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="chicken breast">
<IMG SRC="breast-sobel-thresh.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="chicken breast">
<BR>
and the accumulator before and after log mapping is:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="breast-hough.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="chicken breast">
<IMG SRC="breast-hough-log.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="chicken breast">


<P>
If you got that working, now try a
<A HREF="breast2.pgm">trickier image</A>.
You should be able to get a result like this:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="breast2-result.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="chicken breast">

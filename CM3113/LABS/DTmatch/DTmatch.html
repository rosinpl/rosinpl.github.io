A simple 2D object matcher.
</FONT>

<P>
The image on the left has been edge detected, and the right image shows the
distance transform
(i.e. each pixel in the distance transform image contains the shortest distance
to the nearest feature in the binary edge map)
of the thresholded edges.

<P>
Click on the left hand image to bring up a model of Turing's ear.
Click again for it to imatch.
The model is translated such that the average distance transform values under
the boundary is minimised.

<P>
Notice that
(1) the distance transform values get saturated towards the image boundaries,
so that an ear initialised there won't move;
(2) the model is easily distracted by spurious features - try initialising it
off to the right of the true ear. You should also be able to get a match with
a low mean error to the left eye.

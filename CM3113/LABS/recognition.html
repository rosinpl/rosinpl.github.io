<P>
Play with this simple MATLAB
<A HREF="classifier.zip">code</A>
that implements a linear classifier (based on the bisector of the line between the two class feature centroids)
demo, that uses global region shape measures.

<P>
Try selecting samples from each class to build a classifier, and then see the results.
The 2 rows shown in the window consist of 2 classes of fish (one class per row); note that the rightmost 2 columns have some noise, which causes problems for the circularity shape measure.

<P>
Modify the code to replace circularity with one of MATLAB's other shape measures to see if you can improve the classification accuracy.

<P>
You can also try the first two rotation, translation, and scale (RTS) invariant moments, based on your work for <A HREF="descriptors.html">Lab 4</A>.

<P>
You can improve the simple bisector based linear classifier with better alternatives.
For example, although not covered in class, Fisher's linear discriminant is one good version, and can be implemented relatively straightforwardly in MATLAB.

  </APPLET>

  <P>
  This applet is a copy I made from one written by 
  Christian Brechb&uuml;hler at ETHZ.

  <P>
  It lets you experiment with the rho-theta mapping used by the
  Hough Transform.
  Just click the left mouse button in one of the windows and see the mapping in the
  other. Also try keeping the mouse key depressed and move the cursor.

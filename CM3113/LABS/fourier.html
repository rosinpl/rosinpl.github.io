<H2>Lab Sheet - Week 9</H2>
<H2>Fourier Transform</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Use <B>MATLAB</B> to play with the Fourier Transform.

<P>
Also here are some images of cells for you to experiment with:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="cells1.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="cells">
the basic image
which contains illumination variations
<BR>
<IMG SRC="cells2.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="cells">
added vertical stripes
<BR>
<IMG SRC="cells3.gif" HEIGHT=200 ALT="cells">
added diagonal stripes

<P>
Here are a couple of <B>m-files</B> that you'll need in the directory that you run MATLAB from:
<A HREF="show.m">show.m</A> and <A HREF="edit.m">edit.m</A>.

<P>
Now start up MATLAB and read in an image,
e.g. <B>i = imread('cells1.tif');</B>

<P>
You can display an image using <B>imshow(i);</B>

<P>
The following command will "edit" the power spectrum
<B>j = edit(i,10 ) ;</B>
<BR>
Use it to try to remove the image artifacts.

<HR>

<P>
Now revisit the first task in the Image Acquisition and Early Processing
<A HREF="https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/CM3113/LABS/early.html">Image Acquisition and Early Processing</A>
lab from week 2.
Subsample this 512x512 image of <A HREF="circles3.pgm">circles</A>
and also this 1024x1024 image of <A HREF="lines.pgm">lines</A> 
by a factor of eight.
To avoid aliasing blur the image using a simple low pass filter (e.g. to start you can even use a basic box car filter).
Use the Nyquist Criterion to determine an appropriate amount of filtering which you should apply using the Fourier Transform.

<HR>

<P>
Try out this
<A HREF="http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/HIPR2/fftdemo.htm">applet</A>
which allows you to experiment with the Fourier Transform
and apply various image filtering operations in the frequency domain.

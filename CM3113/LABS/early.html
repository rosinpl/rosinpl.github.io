<P>
Investigate the effects of the Nyquist Criterion.
Subsample this image of <A HREF="circles1.pgm">circles</A>
by a factor of eight.
Do this by simply selecting every eighth pixel in every eighth row
and put them into a new image whose width and height are smaller by a factor of eight.
Now see what happens if before subsampling you first remove the high frequencies,
e.g. by blurring?

<P>
Here's another image of
<A HREF="circles2.pgm">circles</A>
to have a go at.
(As you see, you can generate some pretty pictures by aliasing).

<HR>

<P>
So far you have just looked at operations on single pixels.
Let's move on to local neighbourhood operations.
Write a program to look at each pixel's eight neighbours.
(You may find it easiest to use an extra double loop).
Now you can apply some noise filtering to lena with added
<A HREF="lena-noise1.pgm">Gaussian</A> noise
and
<A HREF="lena-noise2.pgm">salt and pepper</A> noise.
<P>
Write programs to perform
<li>
blurring - i.e. replace each pixel by the average intensity in its neighbourhood
<li>
median filtering - i.e. replace each pixel by the median intensity in its
neighbourhood

<P>
Look at the histograms of the images before and after these operations.
Can you explain why they look the way they do?
(You can download code for a
<A HREF="histogram.py">simple python histogram program</A>.)
<!--
<A HREF="Hist.java">simple Java histogram applet</A>
along with this
<A HREF="Hist.html">html file</A>.)

<HR>

<P>
Implement unsharp masking to improve the appearance of this
<A HREF="lena-blur.pgm">blurry</A> 
version of lena.
You first need to further blur it.
You can experiment with generating varying degrees of blur by repeatedly blurring it.
Subtract the further blurred version from the original (blurry) image and add the
result to the original (blurry) image.
Make sure the output values are in the range 0-255.

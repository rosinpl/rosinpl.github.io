</APPLET> 

<P>
This applet is a copy I made from one written by
Allen K.L. Miu, a graduate student at MIT.

<P>
It has more functionality than you need, so you can ignore the buttons
(just use the default settings of inserting points).
To experiment with the point line duality used by the y=mx+c Hough Transform
just click the left mouse button in one of the windows and see the mapping
in the other. 
Also try keeping the mouse key depressed and move the cursor.

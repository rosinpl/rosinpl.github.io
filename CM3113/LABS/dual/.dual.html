<H1>Duality Demo</H1>
<H2>User Interface</H2>

The user interface requires the user to select two options.  The MODE
option should always be selected first, and then the type of OBJECT to
be inserted.  The applet runs in three modes: Insert, Query, and Edit.
The following sections outline what the user can do for each mode of
operation.  Please not that the applet accepts input from the left mouse
button only.

<H3>Insert Mode</H3>

The user can insert POINT or SEGMENTs.  The duals of these types of
objects will be inserted into the BSP data structure in the dual plane.

<UL>
  <LI>To insert a POINT, select Insert Mode AND POINT.  Then click the
  left mouse button on either plane.  WHEN ENTERING A POINT, BE CAREFUL
  THAT YOU DO NOT GET CONFUSED WITH ENTERING A SEGMENT THAT HAS TWO
  COINCIDING ENDPOINTS.  The BSP queries may not work as you expected
  when this happens.</LI> 
  <LI>To insert a SEGMENT, select Insert Mode AND SEGMENT.  Then click the left
  mouse button to mark the first POINT, drag out the desired SEGMENT
  length and orientation before releasing the button. </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Query Mode</H3>

Objects inserted in Query Mode are NOT inserted into the BSP data
structure.  The Query Mode allows the user to insert ONE SEGMENT query
and a MULTIPLE-SEGMENT QUERY; the applet does not handle primal POINT
queries (I ran out of time).  Triangles and Circles can also be entered
for visualization purposes in the Query Mode but their dual lines are
not entered into the BSP data structure nor is there any BSP query
operations performed with them.structure.

<UL>
  <LI>To insert a LINE Query, select Query Mode AND SEGMENT(LINE).
  Enter the LINE object by a left CLICK.  PLEASE EDIT THE ROTATION AND
  TRANSLATION OF THE QUERY IN "EDIT MODE", as if you were editing a
  LINE.
  </LI>
  <LI>To select a SEGMENT for a MULTIPLE-SEGMENT query, highlight a
  segment and LEFT CLICK.</LI> 
  <LI>To insert a Triangle object, select
  Query Mode AND Triangle.  The first click anchors the first vertex,
  second click anchors the second vertex, and third click completes the
  triangle.
  </LI>
  <LI>To insert a Circle object, select Query Mode AND Circle.  Place
  the center of the circle by a left mouse click.  The radius can be
  changed by selecting EDIT MODE and drag the circle while holding the
  CONTROL key.  The Cicle may be moved in EDIT mode by dragging the
  cirlce without holding the CONTROL key.
  </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Edit Mode</H3>

No objects may be entered in this mode; only translation, rotation and
scaling operations are permitted.  The following outlines what editing
operation is supported for each object.

<UL>
  <LI>POINT - Left CLICK and drag the POINT.  Hold Alt to restrict
  rectilinear translations.</LI>
  <LI>SEGMENT - Left CLICK and drag on main SEGMENT to translate the object
  without rotation.  Left CLICK and drag on either end POINT to translate an
  endpoint.  Left CLICK, CONTROL, and drag on SEGMENT to rotate SEGMENT
  without translation.  Hold down ALT key to restrict rectilinear mouse movements.</LI>
  <LI>Line - Same as line except no endpoint editing</LI>
  <LI>Triangle - Left CLICK on triangle edges to translate Triangle, on an
  endpoint to translate endpoint.  ALT key for recctilinear
  restriction.</LI>
  <LI>Circle - Left CLICK and drag on cirlce to translate the object.
  Hold CONTROL key for changing the radius.</LI>
  <LI>Wedge - Translation is same as Line but rotation is restricted around the
  fulcrum.  Left CLICK and drag fulcrum to translate wedge without
  rotation.</LI>
  <LI>Dual line families of Triangle and Circle - EDITING NOT SUPPORTED</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Remarks</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>I fail to recognize the dual relationship for the LINE query.</LI>
  <LI>I did not the implement the Point Query.</LI> <LI>The set of lines that
  stabs a set of segments correspond to the dual vertices that are
  contained in all of the corresponding dual wedges in the dual plane.
  <LI>An "interesting" dual relationship is demonstrated in the Cirlce
  object.  Mouse over a Circle object and you'll see two yellow vertices
  in the primal plane.  By default, these primal vertices are symmetric
  about the x axis.  The corresponding dual lines are parallel within the
  dual "conic" formed by the Circle.  Hold SHIFT and mouse over the
  Cirlce again, the primal vertices that are symmetric about the center
  of the Circle will be highlighted.  The dual lines are symmetric about
  the the "inner axis" of the conic.  Finally, hold the CONTROL key, the
  vertices that are symmetric about the y axis will be highlighted.  The
  resulting dual lines are symmetric about the intersecting axis of the
  dual conic.
  </LI>

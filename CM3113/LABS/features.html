<H2>Lab Sheet - Week 3</H2>
<H2>Feature Detection</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Write a program to perform the Sobel edge detector.
You can apply it to some of the images we used before
(e.g. the <A HREF="wdg2.pgm">widget</A>)
to check your results.

<HR>

<P>
Now modify your program to make it detect lines (bars).
Apply it to this image of the
<A HREF="forth.pgm">Forth rail bridge.</A>

<P>
(Note: just combine two orthogonal convolution masks in a similar manner to the Sobel edge detector,
although more properly an approach similar to the compass edge detector should be used.)

<HR>

<P>
Using the median filter you wrote in the previous lab
to implement a median based corner detector ("Local ordered grey levels as an aid to corner detection", 1984) and apply it to
these images of office scenes:
<A HREF="office1.pgm">office1</A>
and
<A HREF="inria.pgm">inria</A>.
Just generate the raw cornerity map (median filtered image minus the original image -
and make the value positive!),
don't worry about non-maximal suppression.
If you have time experiment with different sized windows (i.e. larger than 3 by 3
windows).

<P>
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm?
What about applying it to another sort of image such as
<A HREF="lena.pgm">lena</A>

<!--
<HR>

<P>
Finish off by playing with this
<A HREF="Snake/Snake.html">applet</A>

which demonstrates a sophisticated method of object segmentation (using
<B>snakes</B>) applied to an edge detected image.

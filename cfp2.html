Vision is one of the most important sources of information for supporting
intelligent human behaviour, as well as a key competence for designing
new types of intelligent computers and machines. Over the period of the
past 40 years or so, computer vision has evolved into a mature subject
including many topics and applications which range from the automatic interpretation
of documents to the image recognition for the automatic guidance of vehicles.
In reality, however, current computer vision systems are vastly different
from, and in most ways inferior to, biological vision systems.
<p>

Software agents are computer programs capable of flexible, autonomous
action -- and may support a wide range of different behaviours, defined
as rules, or based on machine learning algorithms such as neural networks.
Agents also, generally, monitor their operating environment and respond
to events in a timely fashion, utilising internal scheduling and planning
engines to formulate a response. Perhaps the most significant advantage that an agent
based approach provides is the ability to design systems based on decoupled
units --  based on the particular role that such a unit
is likely to play within a multi-agent system. <p>

Authors are encouraged to submit papers which cover some of the following
issues (although this list is by no means exhaustive):
<ul>
<li>
Agent based image processing</li>

<li>
Real time image analysis using agents</li>

<li>
Scene interpretation using agents</li>

<li>
Image based content retrieval</li>

<li>
Visual queries in semantic search</li>

<li>
Target tracking using agent approaches</li>

<li>
Agent societies to support semantic queries</li>
</ul>
Application papers which demonstrate these ideas - and in particular, show
how the agent based approach is beneficial (or not) - are especially encouraged.

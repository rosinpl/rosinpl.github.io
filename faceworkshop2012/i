<p>
The analysis of faces is a very active research area within both the computer vision and the human
perception communities. Although the two communities have traditionally worked separately, the
synergy created by the meeting of minds from both communities will not only provide for great
research impetus, but will also allow otherwise intractable problems to be solved. The array of
potential applications and research topics is impressive. The goal of this workshop is to examine
existing work that straddles the border of these communities, and to map out future steps for
integrative research.

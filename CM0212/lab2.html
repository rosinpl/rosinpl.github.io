<h1>CM0212 - Algorithms II and Data Structures</h1>

<h2>Lab Sheet #2 - Week 7</h2>

<p>
Implement in Java a flood fill algorithm (similar to the facilities available in standard graphics packages
such as Photoshop)
using a stack (rather than recursion).

</p><p>
Take as input a binary PGM image in which values are either 0 or 255;
this can be stored as a two-dimensional array containing integer pixel
values.
Select a position in the image (either hardcoding it or taking input from the user) and fill it and all
neighbouring white (255) pixels, recolouring those pixels gray (e.g. 128).
Continue this process until none of the pixels in the gray region
have white neighbouring pixels.
Remember to check for image boundaries to avoid "falling off"
the image array.

</p><p>
So you will have to check a pixel's neighbours, its white neighbours' neighbours, their neighbours, and so on.
To keep track of all these neighbours the stack is used to store them temporarily. Neighbours waiting to
be processed are pushed on the stack and then popped off later when your algorithm is ready to processed them.

</p><p>
To make your life easier I've provided the following Java
<a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/CM0212/Image.java">class</a>
to read and write a PGM image,
and here's a fragment of 
<a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/CM0212/Fill.java">code</a>
to start you off.
So that you can see exactly how it all works, use the
<a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/CM0212/#stacks">stack code</a> (4 files) available from 
my webpage rather than Java's built-in stack.
Try out your implementation on the following thresholded image of
<a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/CM0212/lena-pre.pgm">Lena</a>.

</p><p>
Starting with the lena image

<br>
and filling from (60,30) your program should produce the following output image

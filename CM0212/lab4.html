<H2>Lab Sheet #4 - Week 10</H2>

Write a Java program to store, remove, and retrieve positive integers
using hashing (<B>NOT</B> using the built-in Java Hashtable class).
<P>
To keep implementation simple, store entries in an array and
handle collisions using linear or double hashing.
<P>
You can flag empty/deallocated table entries with negative values
(rather than shifting entries to fill the gaps).
<P>

<P>
To remind yourself how hashing works it would be a good idea to have a look at the
<a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Paul.Rosin/CM0212/DEMOS/HashApplet/HashApplet.html">demo</a> on my webpage,
which includes linear probing and other collision resolution schemes.

Paul,

  I've just thrown the Gnu GPL at the top of the file.  I'm attaching
  the source below.    Please keep in mind that I had not taken time
  to explicitly prepare for distributing the source (i.e. the program
  is not well documented, and not necessarily exemplary in style).

  Let me know if you have any further questions.

Michael

<font size=+1><b>Usage:</b></font>
Type an integer into the text field.  Click on the <b>Add Node</b>
button to begin insertion of a red node with the specified integer
value.  Click on the <b>Next Step</b> button to see what happens on
the next iteration of insertion.  Click on the <b>Restart</b> button
to start from an empty tree.  To delete a node, click on the <b>Delete
Node</b> button, then click on the node you wish to delete.  The node
should turn green.  Click on the <b>Next Step</b> button repeatedly to
see the steps involved in deleting the node.  The delete feature is
not fully tested and some deletions may result in trees that lose
their red/black properties.  Please report problems to 
<a href="mailto:franco@gauss.ececs.uc.edu">franco@gauss.ececs.uc.edu</a>.
Click on the <b>Undo</b> button to
restore the tree to it's state before the last node was inserted or
deleted.  See any elementary data structures text for a description
of the rules of insertion and deletion including rotation and color
reversals.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>Red/Black Trees:</b></font>  These are binary trees
with the following properties.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Every node has a value.
<li>
The value of any node is greater than the value of its left child and less
than the value of its right child.
<li>
Every node is colored either red or black.
<li>
Every red node that is not a leaf has only black children.
<li>
Every path from the root to a leaf contains the same number of black
nodes.
<li>
The root node is black.
</ol>
<p>
An <i>n</i> node red/black tree has the property that its height is
<i>O(lg(n))</i>.  Another important property is that a node can be
added to a red/black tree and, in <i>O(lg(n))</i> time, the tree can
be readjusted to become a larger red/black tree.  Similarly, a node
can be deleted from a red/black tree and, in <i>O(lg(n))</i> time,
the tree can be readjusted to become smaller a red/black tree.
Due to these properties, red/black trees are useful for data storage.
<p>
<font size=+2><b>Insertion:</b></font> The rules for readjustment when
inserting depend on the concept of rotation.

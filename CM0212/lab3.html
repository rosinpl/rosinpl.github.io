<H2>Lab Sheet #3 - Week 8</H2>

Write a Java program that stores a binary tree as an array.
<P>
The values can be hardwired into the code to avoid bothering with handling
input, and so this part does not involve much coding.
<P>
To start off, you should work out how to index a node's parent and children.
<P>
Now traverse through the tree in preorder, inorder, and postorder,
printing out the node values.

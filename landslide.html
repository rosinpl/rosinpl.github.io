<H1>Landslide Detection</H1>
<P>
Detecting landslides and monitoring their activity is of great relevance
for disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation in hilly areas.
To this end, we have investigated and developed a variety of
change detection techniques that have been applied 
to multi-temporal digital aerial photographs.
This works involves various strategies for image differencing and thresholding,
shape analysis, texture based classification and genetic programming.

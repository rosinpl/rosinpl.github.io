<H1>MSc Project Timeline (CMT400, CMT401, CMT402)</H1>

<P>
This is to give you some more details guidance on how to set up your
MSc project and how to use the Project Allocation and Tracking System (PATS)
to propose/view projects.
</P>

<P>
The following are the main steps you follow to set up your project:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<!-
TO UPDATE VARIOUS DATES HERE...........
Between now and the end of WEEK 8
->
Up until the end of WEEK 8
of Spring Semester,
you may submit a project proposal, through the web site at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/PATS">www.cs.cf.ac.uk/PATS</A>.
<!-
You will be registered on the system.....
->
To use the system, use your normal
<!-
username (e.g. c1234567) and the default password that will be sent to you by email.
WHEN??????
->
username (e.g. c1234567) and the default password that has been sent to you by email.
<!-
TO UPDATE
->
The system is now open for you to submit your proposal.

<BR>
<BR>
The proposal should be no longer than a single A4 page and must give
the following detail: your name, degree scheme, project title, project
aims &amp; objective, brief description of the project, resource
requirement (hardware/software requirement).

<BR>
<BR>
Four example proposals are listed below. Please note that these examples
are FOR EXAMPLE ONLY, and you should not think that they are
acceptable and others not. My advice is that you should go to the
library to have a look at a wide range of past projects, to get an
idea of what a good project is, and then follow the STYLE of the
examples given here to propose your own project.

<BR>
<BR>
Your proposals will not be seen by staff until WEEK 9,
so there is no need for you to worry about getting in there first.
</LI>

<BR>
<LI>
In WEEK 9, you may talk to members of staff about the project you
propose to do. If there is a member of staff who is willing to
supervise your proposed project, then your project is set - your
proposed project will be your MSc project.

<BR>
<BR>
If any staff member is interested in your proposal, they can indicate so by using 
PATS, and you will be able to see that interest
expressed immediately on your page when you log in to use the system.

However, please bear in mind that if you see an interest
expressed by a staff member in your project, it DOES NOT mean that you
have that staff member as your supervisor! You must have a
<A HREF="MSc_Supervision_Agreement_Form.pdf">project agreement form</A>
signed in order to have your project set
(leave this form with your supervisor).

Moreover, you may need to be proactive, and so my advice is that
you should go to the staff member(s) who have expressed an
interest in your project first, but approach other staff members for
supervision if necessary.
</LI>

<BR>
<LI>
If you did not submit your project proposal, or did not manage to get
a member of staff to agree to supervise your proposed project, then in
WEEK 10 you have an opportunity to select one from the projects
that are proposed by staff, and will become available on PATS.

<BR>
<BR>
On PATS you can view the list of projects and
express your interests in as many projects as you like
by selecting them on PATS
(clicking the corresponding check box for the projects
and click the Register Interest button at the bottom of the page).

<BR>
<BR>
Again, you may need to be proactive, and contact the members of staff
direct (not via PATS).
You may approach any member of staff about
their projects within WEEK 10. If a member of staff accepts you,
then your project is set - that staff proposed project is your 
MSc project.
</LI>

<BR>
<LI>
If you do not manage to get a project set by the end of WEEK 10, I
will assign you a project from the remaining projects proposed by
staff in WEEK 11. You will have to accept whatever is assigned to you.
</LI>

<BR>
<LI>
In Weeks 9 and 10 I will email again to explain how you should contact
staff members and have your project set.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Some other points to note regarding your project:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
One of your project deliverables is to
demonstrate your project to your supervisor before you submit
your project at the end of summer.
Although the demo is
not itself marked, the project will not be marked unless the
demo has been carried out and the appropriate
<A HREF="MSc_Demo_Assessment_Form.pdf">form</A>
handed in!
</LI>

<BR>
<LI>
Remember that you are responsible for organising the binding of your
dissertation (not the School).
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
I hope that you now understand the procedure we use to set up your
project and it is in your own interests to start thinking about your
FY project now!
</P>

<P>
If you have any problems then please contact Dr Paul Rosin
(<A HREF="mailto:Paul.Rosin@cs.cf.ac.uk">Paul.Rosin@cs.cf.ac.uk</A>).

<H2>Example Project 1</H2>
<pre>Name: Music Fan
Degree Scheme: MSc Computer Science

Project Title: Music toolbox for guitar players.

Project Aims &amp; Objectives
-------------------------

Learning how to write a Java application with IBM Visual Age. Study
the Sound and MIDI API of Java. Use artificial intelligence to read
and change characters in a text file. Implement Database connectivity
with JDBC.

Brief description of the project
--------------------------------

Java application providing a musical instrument tuner, a text chord
transposer and a database of music score.

* The Tuner will generate MIDI sound according to preset or customised
  tuning types, according to what instrument is to be tuned.

* The Chord transposer uses a text file containing chords names
  (letter A to G) and lyrics; Scans the file to recognise chords from
  the lyrics; and lets the user decide how to transpose the chords by
  interval of 1 semitone higher or lower, or let the program choose
  "intelligently" the key change that will be the easier to play on a
  guitar.

* The database connection will let the user to pick up a particular
  music file from a local database according to various criteria. It
  will also include a mechanism to search for a score on the internet
  OLGA network (On-Line Guitar Archive).

Resource Requirement (hardware/software requirement)
----------------------------------------------------

I have Visual Age for Java on my computer, so there is no need to have
it in the labs. For the demonstration, the computer needs to have a
sound card, and speakers.
</pre>

<H2>Example Project 2</H2>

<pre>Name: E-Business
Degree Scheme: MSc Computer Science

Project Title: Sporting Goods e-commerce Site.

Project Aims &amp; Objectives
-------------------------

- Provide understanding of the subject of e-commerce.
- Explore background of Internet, web technologies, databases and
  security issues.
- Provide overview on subject of e-commerce and implications for
  business activities in general and those specific to the shop.
- Analysis of web site design.
- Devise a well-designed web site linking securely to a database for
  online transactions/orders.
- Comprehensively test and evaluate the sites e-commerce features.

Brief description of the project
--------------------------------

Intend to collaborate with a small sports shop who have an interest in
setting up an e-commerce site, as they have a lot stock some of which
cannot be displayed in the shop. So setting up an enterprise site
would enable them to display and sell stock online. It would also
potentially expand their client base. Therefore I intend to
comprehensively study their needs and build a web site connected to a
database specifically for them.

Resource Requirement (hardware/software requirement)
----------------------------------------------------

- HTML.
- ORACLE or ACCESS database.
- JAVA programming language.
- MS Windows OS.

-------------------------

* To look at the privacy implications of using cloud computing
* To look at the security implications of using cloud computing
* To analyse whether cloud computer can complete their finance
  documents and investment appraisal
* To look at the benefits and drawbacks that cloud computing can bring
  to an organisation
* To look at whether cloud computing adhere to financial legislation
  of all sizes of companies (i.e. sole trader, partnerships and PLCs
  etc)
* To look at how cloud computing is constructed and how it can be used

Brief description of the project
--------------------------------

The project will look at whether an organisation can use cloud
computing within their finance departments. This will include looking
at the recording of financial transaction through double entry
bookkeeping, preparing and analysing financial statements, preparing

               Identification device for local and University football
               clubs.

Project Aims and Objectives
---------------------------

To research whether it is feasible to create a radio frequency
identification device and to develop it. In addition to this an aim
will be to create a website or application to view the data on.

Brief Description of the project
--------------------------------

To use my research to identify whether it is possible to develop a
radio frequency identification device for footballer clubs who are on
a tight budget. I will be looking at Sunday league teams and
University teams. I will be also looking at a way of presenting the
data collected whether it is on a website or down loadable
application.

Resource Requirements (hardware/software requirement)
-----------------------------------------------------

I will need to buy and use a radio frequency identification device if
it is feasible. I will also need to use the programming language C.
For the presenting the data HTML and SQL may be possible ways of
presenting the data depending on research findings.
